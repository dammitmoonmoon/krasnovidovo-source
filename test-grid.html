        <p>The Krasnovidovo station was established in 2002 on the basis of the Water Reservoirs Laboratory of the Land Hydrology Department, which in turn was founded on the basis of the MSU Faculty of Geography field station. The idea to set up the station was originally proposed by Nikolai Adolfovich Solntsev-Elba (21.02.1902 – 6.11.1991), who at the beginning of 1944 submitted a memo to the Dean of the Faculty of Geography Professor S.D. Muraveisky explaining the need to establish a permanent geographical field station in the vicinity of Moscow. The setting up of the station was supervised by Professors S.D. Muraveisky and K.K. Markov (the Faculty Dean since the autumn of 1945). Its first director was N.N. Gulidov.
